# Mreow-!Lang
##### The tonal 'meow' language. 

Mreow!Lang or MLang for short makes use of letters to indicate mood and special characters to indicate tone. It's a Tonal Language with lots of heart and 3 years of development :>.

# Other Notes

This Language is ment as a JOKE!!! This is not meant to be taken seriously, however it is a completely functional language, in that you are able to have a conversation soley in Mlang! 

MLang will more then likely have more use as an inline way to indicate mood and tone rather then a seperate language all together.
