# What is a Tonal Language?

## Tones in English

Tones in english help indicate intention and mood when talking to a person. For example. Imagine the following senario; 
A friend is telling you about something that happened at work/school. "And then she shouted at me!". 

That single extract from a whole conversation doesn't mean much. There is not a lot of context. 

> Now let's try adding some tone. '"And then she shouted at me!" he said breathlessly, wheezing with Laughter.' 

With that addition, we now know much more, right? 

## Tones are hard though...

I agree tones are hard! But they don't have to be.

Tone tagging is something we use in English (especially online) for accessablity. A list of tags are used to explicitly state the indended tone of a message.

It takes the nesessity of multiple words to describe tone ( see above example ^^ ) to a very condensed tag.

> For example: 'And then she shouted at me! LOL'

> Or another example: 'You're such a dork /j' 

These two examples make use of codensed tone tags to indicate the mood and intention of the message. 

## The lack of 'meaning' in Tonal Languages

Tones, as we have convered so far, indicate mood and intention. However tones are ***modifiers***  of language. They take in the meaning of a word or phrase and modfy it's meaning in some way. This is what we see with all of our examples so far. 

However, in a Tonal Language, you only have tones. and tone's without meanings to modify can create some confusion. For exmaple:

Here are a list of moods:
 - Happy
 - Sad
 - Excited
 - Tired

Here are a list of intentions:
 - Joking
 - Sarcasm
 - Light hearted
 - Funny

Now I can go ahead and use plain English as a tonal language.

> For exmaple: Happy Sad Happy Funny

> Another Example: Excited Sarcasm

We can see that in these cases, there is nothing being communicated, no idea being talked about. 

This is in contrast to English, take a word like "Cat". The word Cat has a meaning. It means what a cat is. When you say the word cat, you are refering to the entity, cat. The cute fluffy things that Mlang is inspired by ;3.

So how does one go about having a conversation using Tonal Language?

## Assumed Conversation Structure

Now that we have covered [[what-is-a-tonal-language#Tones are hard though...|Tones]], we can move on to the second aspect of Tonal Languages. Assumed conversation strucuture.

ACS (Assumed Converstaion Structure) is a way to have a conversation without actually communicating words which have some meaing attached.

English makes use of ACS in a few minor ways. For example when greeting someone, you start with a greeting of some kind and then, usually, you might ask them how their day went or is going. This is the assumed structure. Languages like English allow the breaking of these conventions. However in MLang we can make use of this context 'surplus'.

### First Conversation

Take saying hello to another person using English..

> You can say "hello!" And they can say "Hello!" back.

Now let's see that in Tonal

> You can say "happy" and they can say "excited-happy".

Now lets take a peek at MLang. Note that you will not understand this untill you have seen [[basics/letters.md|Lettering]] in MLang. 

> You can say "Mrew" and they can say "Mreww!".

## So what is a tonal language then?

Well a tonal language is a language that communicates mood and indicates intention. It is a simple language that is mainly used for fun. Tonal language can be used as a daily primary language but our world is set up to use communication in the sense we are most fimiliar with. However for fun convos with friends, this is fine. 

Remember, nothing is stopping you from using both MLang and English. Adding a meow here and there can be a easy way to inject some more context aobut mood and intention into your conversation and of course. It's cute :3.
